# Explanation
This is the **master** branch for a [YouTube](https://youtu.be/y5iRTDhiK_A) video series, where, starting from one of the [assignment branches](https://github.com/AndrewCodesGames/AndrewCodesGames-SFML-Tutorial/tree/Assignment1), you are to fulfill the request from your producer on a mock video game project. Additionally, I will complete these assignments myself and post a video of me coding and talking through a solution.

***Important*** - This branch will always be up to date with the solution from the latest assignment. If you want to do one of the assignments yourself, you will need to follow the instructions below to sync to one of the assignment branches, which only contain the changes from previous assignments.

## What's the purpose of this?
The purpose is to improve your C++ and game development skills in a realistic mock-environment. As a *real* video game developer, you would be working on an existing code base and fullfilling requests from your producer.

### Things you'll encounter along the way
- Bugs in the existing code base.
- Requests that can be interpreted in various ways.
- Code architecture choices.
- Design choices (code is the canvas for design!).
