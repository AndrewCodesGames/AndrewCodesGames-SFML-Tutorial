# Explanation
This branch is for a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@AndrewCodesGames) video series, where, starting from this branch, you are to fullfill the requests from your producer on a video game project. Additionally, I will also do this assignment myself and post a video showing my thoughts/coding as I progress through it.

# Assignment 2 - Email From Producer

Hey Andrew,

Nice work on the tower placement. It was intuitive to our playtest group when it was valid or invalid to place a tower. Additionally, we had positive director feedback on the spinning axes.

Next, we'd like to add support for damage text being displayed. In the future, this will allow the player to make more informed decisions by showing them the efficacy of their towers, as well as add a nice visual flair.

Some details below.

## **Damage Text**
- When an enemy is dealt damage, we'd like text to be displayed showing the amount of damage.
- The text should be at the location where the enemy took damage.
- The text should pop in, but fade out.
- New damage numbers should always render over old damage numbers.

If you have any questions, please reach out!

Best,
Producer
