# Explanation
This branch is for a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@AndrewCodesGames) video series, where, starting from this branch, you are to fullfill the requests from your producer on a video game project. Additionally, I will also do this assignment myself and post a video showing my thoughts/coding as I progress through it.

# Assignment 3 - Email From Producer

Hey Andrew,

Nice work on the damage text. We'd now like to continue revising the core game loop. Instead of using a life/level system, we'd like to try out a sort of endless/idle tower defense mode.

This game mode will increase in difficulty just as the game does currently, but will decrease in difficulty whenever the player would lose life. The idea here is to keep the game's difficulty relative to the current strength of the player's towers. Our lead designer said "think cookie-clicker, but instead of clicking cookies, you're playing tower defense".

Some details below for the first iteration.

## **Endless Mode**
- We'd like to be able to visualize the currently difficulty level. This can just be a number for this first iteration.
- Whenever the player takes damage, the difficulty level should decrease.
- The difficulty level should increase on a set interval, just as it does now.
- (bonus) it would also be nice to see how much gold the player is earning per second, as some indication of how well they are doing.

If you have any questions, please reach out!

Best,
Producer
